👋 Hi, I’m @catherinecsun! I am a quantititive ecologist/data scientist with the Zambian Carnivore Programme. I'm based in Zambia, but originally hail from the east coast of the US. I've also spent time on the west coast in Canada. I analyse a wide range of data types, from noninvasive camera trap data to GPS data from radiocollared animals, to understand population dynamics, demographics, and status. The goal is to use ecological inferences from robust quantitiave approaches to help conserve and protect wildlife in the face of increasing (and mostly anthropogenic) threats.   I also really enjoy  field work.

👀 More technically, I’m interested in data viz, linear models, Bayesian approaches, AI, and new statistical analyses/modeling approaches.

🌱 I currently work mostly in R, but at some point I'd like to learn Python. 

💞️ Diversity, equity, and inclusion are very important to me, and I want to see more of it in the STEM and Wildlife communities!
