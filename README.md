ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @catherinecsun! I am a quantititive ecologist/data scientist with the Zambian Carnivore Programme. I analyse a wide range of data types, from noninvasive camera trap data to GPS data from radiocollared animals, to understand population dynamics, demographics, and status across different spatial and temporal scales. The goal is to use ecological inferences from robust quantitiave approaches to help conserve and protect wildlife in the face of increasing (and mostly anthropogenic) threats. I also really enjoy field work.

ðŸ‘€ Interests include data visualization, linear models, Bayesian approaches, AI, and new statistical analyses/modeling approaches.

ðŸŒ± I work mostly in R, but would like to learn Python. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me ... Im on twitter at @catsunbear!
